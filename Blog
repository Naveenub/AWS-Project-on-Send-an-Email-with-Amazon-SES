With Amazon SES, you can send transactional email, marketing messages, or any other type of high-quality content to your customers.

Implementation:-

Step 1 : Verify your Email address
1. Navigate to the "Amazon SES console", at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses.
2. On the Amazon SES home page, choose "Get started". 
3. Enter your "email address", and choose "Next".
4. Enter your "sending domain", and choose "Next".
   > If your domain is www.example.com, enter example.com as your domain. Don't include the "www." part, because the domain verification process won't succeed if you do.
Note: For your initial domain, it is recommended that you verify a valid domain that displays identifiable information about your organization to establish your reputation with AWS as a trusted email sender.
5. Leave default selections for "Add MAIL FROM domain" - optional, and choose "Next".
6. Review your inputs, and choose "Get started".
7. "Sign in" to the email client you use to receive email for the email address you entered in the previous step.
8. In your email client, "open" the message from Amazon Web Services asking you to confirm that you own the email address. "Select" the link in the message.
9. Navigate back to the "Amazon SES console", and "confirm" that the status of the email address in the Amazon SES console is "verified".

Step 2 : Verify your domain
1. On the "Get set up" page, in the "Verify sending domain" section, choose "Get DNS records".
2. From the "Publish DNS records" table, "copy records" that appear in this section to be published (added) to your DNS provider.
Alternatively, you can choose "Download .csv record set" to save a copy of the records to your computer.
3. "Log into" your domainâ€™s DNS or web hosting provider, and then "add" the records containing the values that you copied or saved previously.
Note: Different providers have different procedures for updating DNS records. See the DNS/Hosting provider table following these procedures. 
4. Navigate back to the Amazon SES console, and "refresh" the set up page. "Confirm" that the status of the domain in the Amazon SES console is "verified".

Step 3 : Send an Email
1. Navigate back to the "Get setup" page, in the "Send test email" section, choose "Send test email".
2. On the "Send test email" page, make the following changes:
   > For Email format, choose "Raw".
   > For From-address, leave "default input".
   > For Scenario, choose "Custom".
   > For Custom recipient, enter the "email address" you previously verified.
   > For Message, "copy and paste" the following message into the provided text box.
